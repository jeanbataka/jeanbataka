## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jean Bataka and I come from TOGO <TG> ; I am passionate about computer tools so I became a web achitect ðŸ˜Ž.<br />
<br />
I am an eternal learner of new technologies in order to get out of my comfort zone. I like challenges to push myself further. I use every day **PHP** with the **LARAVEL** framework;
I had to work on projects using **VueJS** which I fell in love with!<br />
<br />
I also use **NodeJs** with **expressJs** for my api development and **MongoDb** (one of my NoSQL favorites).
Thanks to mongoDb I discovered **Robot3T** ([Studio3T](https://robomongo.org/)) which allows among other things : 
- Easy MongoDB Connections Manager
- IntelliShell with fast auto-completion
---
To automate my tasks I don't hesitate to use [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) whether it's for a quick deployment on server or continuous integration.

> I'm open to any project proposals and collaborations

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a backend web developer on a web application for microfinance which among other things allows to manage customer accounts, tontines, their savings and much more.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cloud technologies (Aws and Google cloud) and Golang
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me everything about Laravel, VueJs
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like playing video games ðŸ˜‰
